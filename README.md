# Government Fixer

**This is a [Code for Yourtown](https://yourtown.code) project designed to fix government!** Currently, we're focused on small/local government, though we may scale up in the future.

 This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and uses JavaScript/React. Please see [Code for Yourtown docs for setting up Node.js](https://yourtown.code/guides/setup/nodejs) to install prerequisites for this project.

## Install

In the project directory, you can run:

`yarn install`

## Run the application locally

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Run tests

`npm test`

Right now, we have only one integration test that makes sure the application doesn't crash. `npm test` launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## Build application for deployment

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Deploy the App to GH Pages

`npm run deploy`

This will build the application and deploy it to GitHub Pages, using the `gh-pages` branch. See the Create React App section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
